Run the following command to compile java files in the source\classLoading folder, if additional folders are added, add them to this command before the -d option.
This folder is for various java files used to test dynamic reloading that cannot be part of the eclipse project's source/build path.
Navigate to the classpath folder, then run the following command:

"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_25\bin\javac" -sourcepath source -classpath C:\Users\TeamworkGuy2\Documents\Java\Projects\ClassLoading\res source\classLoading\*.java source\classLoading\base\*.java source\classLoading\load\*.java -d destination
